# 2017 Pittsburg Seafood & Music Festival

## About the Project

## How to Contribute
The easiest way to successfully merge a pull request into master would be to open up a feature branch to tackle a specific bug/ feature on the issues section of the repp. Upon completion of a particular feature or bug-fix, merge your code into master and delete your branch. For more details on the typical agile development workflow, take a look at this article: http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2008/12/18/agile-git-and-the-story-branch-pattern

## Development
To get started with development, first clone this repo to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/MosesSupposes/2017-Pittsburg-Seafood-and-Music-Festival/edit/master/README.md
```

[Next, open up the live site in your browser:](https://2017pittsburgseafoodandmusicfestival.com)

Then, open up the dev tools (F12 for chrome or Crtl/Cmd + Shift + J for firefox). Link the browser's active directory to your cloned directory on your local machine. If done correctly, all of your changes made to the online editor will be reflected in your machine's file system. 

Finally, push your feature additions or bug fixes to master by opening a pull request and awaiting a code review from a fellow team member. (Feel free to request a review!)
