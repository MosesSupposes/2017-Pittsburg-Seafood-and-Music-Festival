## About the Project

## How to Contribute
The easiest way to successfully merge a pull request into master would be to open up a feature branch to tackle a specific bug/ feature on the issues section of the repp. Upon completion of a particular feature or bug-fix, merge your code into master and delete your branch. For more details on the typical agile development workflow, take a look at this article: http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2008/12/18/agile-git-and-the-story-branch-pattern
